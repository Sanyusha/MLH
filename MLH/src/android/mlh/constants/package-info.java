/**
 * This package contains contains classes with constants.

/*
 * 
 * TODO: each class with constants has to be build like this:
 *  - private constructor
 *  - public static final fields
 *  - in Target class we use static import: import static Constants.PLANCK_CONSTANT;
 *  
 *  That way we can use constants in Target class without
 *  need to reference the namespace.
 *
 *	Maybe each constants class should be seated in the package of its usage?
